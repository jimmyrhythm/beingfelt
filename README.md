Known Issues:
* Only tested with Oculus Quest 1 and 2. On other headsets the VR should work, but maybe not the controlers.
* Thumbstick to drop a puppet, controls need better conveyance. 
* Each of us hides a secret pain.

This is a VR puppet show. Right now it's just just one-headset, but other people could take the controllers. On oculus the contrller trigger and d-pad do the mouth and eyes. I wanted to explore the idea that your avatar isnt your head. 

one pupptet per hand

you can also drag the mirror

and the sun and moon

you can get pretty realitic eye rolls
