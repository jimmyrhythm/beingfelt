# Being Felt
VR Puppet Art Sandbox using Aframe for WebXR support.

[Live Demo](https://jimmyrhythm.github.io/beingfelt/)

Known Issues:
* Only tested with Oculus Quest 1 and 2.
* Thumbstick to drop a puppet, controls need better conveyance. 
* Each of us hides a secret pain.

This is a VR puppet show. Right now it's just just one-headset, but other people could take the controllers.
